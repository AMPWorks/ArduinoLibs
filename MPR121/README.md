MPR121
======

This library enables interaction with the MPR121 chip, a 12-channel capacitive
touch chip which communicates over I2C.

Additionally it provides a class to track interactions with the capacitive touch
sensors, including detecting taps, double-taps, and tracking the time between
touches.

----------------
This code was initially based on the MPR121 example code provided by Sparkfun: https://github.com/sparkfun/MPR121_Capacitive_Touch_Breakout/tree/master/Firmware/MPR121Q/Arduino%20Sketch


Future work
-----------
* Integrate additional functionality from the Adafruit library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPR121_Library)
